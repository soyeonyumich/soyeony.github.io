        <div class="p2">
            Users responded positively to the brief descriptions of how the buttons work in the app, which helps those unfamiliar with smartphone apps, such as elderly users, and reduces confusion.


        </div>
        <div class="p2">After user testing, some users experienced difficulty with the AI, particularly in terms of customization, providing multiple options, and integrating into their schedules. To address this, we added a customized options onboarding process where users can input their personal interests.
             Additionally, the AI now has a friendly personality, making it easier for users to browse through all the options it generates.</div>

        <div class="p1">Lesson 💡</div>
        <div class="p2">This project emphasized the critical importance of user interviews, particularly in understanding the perspective of elderly users who may be unfamiliar with smartphones and new technology.
             It taught me to prioritize simplicity in app functionality, ensuring that elderly users can navigate and use the app with ease.
        </div>
        <div class="p2">Additionally, this project taught me how to independently manage an entire project from start to finish.</div>

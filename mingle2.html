            several areas for improvement have been identified

        </div>

        <ol class="num1">
            <li><div class="set"><mark class="highlight">Settings Menu:</mark></div> Users found the settings menu underutilized due to inconsistent placement,
                 indicating a need for better visibility and accessibility.</li>
            <li><div class="set"><mark class="highlight">Interface:</mark></div> While the interface was generally described as user-friendly, some feature labels
                 were ambiguous and should be made more descriptive for better clarity.</li>
            <li><div class="set"><mark class="highlight">Search Function:</mark></div> Users emphasized the importance of a search function specifically for finding restaurants.</li>
            <li><div class="set"><mark class="highlight">Navigation:</mark> </div>The absence of a "back" button and a navigation bar was noted, which hindered the ability to navigate within the app. 
                Implementing clear and accessible navigation controls would greatly enhance the user experience by allowing users to move through the app seamlessly.

            <div class="p2">I received user feedback by doing the test with other users, 
             where other students tested out the prototype.</div>
             <div class="p2">Overall, feedback on the app was positive, with praise for the consistency of the UI and the practicality of the features. 
                 They appreciated its ability to resolve common issues faced by group food ordering.</div>
             <div class="p2">Some users experienced difficulty with the choice options for the allergic section, which would be great, 
                 so I went back to prototyping and designed the page for someone who is allergic.</div>
     
             <div class="p1">Lesson 💡</div>
             <div class="p2">Through this project, I was able to gain great insights into the complexity of UX design and learn the fundamental procedures involved in independently developing an app idea. In order to finish a challenging job before the deadline, 
                 I was able to acquire good time management and obstacle-navigating skills.</div>
             <div class="p1">Improvement ✨</div>
             <div class="p6">I'm going to keep refining my design and adding features like a chat function for group members to interact with one another. In order to get more feedback and make sure the app is usable by everyone, I also intend to test it with a larger group of users. All things considered, 
                 I'm eager to keep honing my UX design abilities and using technology to solve practical issues.</div>
